# Readme

## Setup
Run `npm i` in both the `server` and `client` directories **separately** to install the dependencies.

## Client
`cd` to the client directory and run `npm start` command in one terminal to start the client-side/frontend.

## Server
`cd` to the server directory and run `npm run dev` command in another terminal to start the server/backend.

## Extra settings
For the server, create an app password for your **email**.  
In the `app.js` file in the server directory, put your email and app password in **auth**.  

Happy Coding :)
