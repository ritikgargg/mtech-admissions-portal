DONE: { Do something with applicant ID - not sure if required? } [NO USE :) email op]

DONE: { REMOVED THE APPLICATION FROM HOME PAGE ON SUBMITTING } Disable apply button(only if corresponding application filled)

DONE: { Prefill values in the application form corresponding to the applicantion selected, must (Branch and Specialization), also add the same in the application table}

DONE: { Success Page on form submission }

DONE: { Cross and cancel button are set to reload the window, find a better option }

DONE: { Order change, drop-downs added in apply }

What to do if we go back after submitting, must be redirected to home and not allowed to revisit that page

/apply should not directly redirect applicant to application form [profile validation must be checked]

On form submission, show some loading message until all the values are pushed into the database and gcp by server
