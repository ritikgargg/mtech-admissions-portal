Stakeholder remarks

1. Heading - Admission cycle for year 2022-2023 (Confirm first) ( DONE )

2. Default closing date for all offerings, along with individual closing dates allowed [DONE on UI, but not on Backend]

3. Any other or staff role in admin portal, same responsibility as faculty [DONE ALMOST]

4. Allow faculty to see applications from different departments 

5. Faculty can add offerings but only admin can approve

6. Remove eligibility from inside of the portal

7. Download all documents of one candidate on one click (as a single file)

8. Do not permanently delete data

9. Dynamic result generation based on inputs
a. Faculty can select all the allowed degree specializations from the data and then can download data based on that

10. COAP, GATE(complex bitches) format on applicant side

11. 
a. Enter gate score and not gate percentile while filling application (help message). 
b. Use the fact that GATE score is never a decimal
c. If he writes score less than or equal to 100, then, ask him if he is sure

12. Fees category vs actual category (can't do shit)

13. Maybe allow admin to change application data, maybe maintain duplicate copies(one actual, one edited), Maybe allow changes taking confirmation from both

Logs maintain for the changes

Maybe give time for editting application after submission (for like 2-3 days)

That is reapply only before deadline
And editing for 2-3 days after deadline

14. Information brochure for detailed information on website which can be downloaded and all
