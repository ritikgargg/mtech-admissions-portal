            How MS(R) program is different than an M.Tech program?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content"> 
          <p>The basic idea of two programs are different. M. Tech. program is oriented towards masters in engineering while MS(R) program is oriented towards research. Due to the basic approach of two programs, we see a couple of differences <br/>

    
<br/>
(a) M. Tech. program has more course work then MS(R). A typical course work of M. Tech. will spread over minimum two semesters.<br/>
(b) In MS(R) student spend most of the time in doing research. Due to nature of research, a student may take more than two years to graduate from MS(R) program.<br/>
(c) MS(R) is evaluated based on his/her research output (typically in form of publications). While for M Tech, final project could be implementation or research, therefore, publications is not mandatory.</p>

        What are the career options after MS(R) or what are the job opportunities after MS(R)
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content"> 
          <p>Since MS(R) is research oriented, there are following possibilities:<br/>

(a) Further studies,  PhD: By the end of MS(R) you would already have some publications. So it is easier to get admission in PhD.<br/>
(b) Industry <br/> 
(i) Research oriented profile:  Based on type of research that candidate have done during MS(R), s/he can apply to various companies that have research labs in India, such as Microsoft research, IBM research, HP research, Xerox research, Intel labs, Google labs, etc <br/>
(ii) Research and Development profile: In computer science many companies prefer a research oriented profile for research and development jobs. As it the candidate bring better understanding of the concern subject matter. This kind of profile generally require some development experience during IIT Ropar <br/>

        As MS(R) is new in IIT Ropar, will it have good placements?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content"> 
          <p>MS(R) students are eligible to sit in companies that visit for campus placements. In computer science, in general good number of companies visit campus.


In addition to that, student may approach companies that work in his area of research. Based on student's expertise, companies may conduct off-campus interview for them.</p>

        Is it actually better to do MS(R) or M.Tech.
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content"> 
          <p>As a rule of thumb, to build research profile, one should do MS(R) and to increase the industry job prospects one should do M. Tech. However, this rule of thumb is not very hard rule. Students after finishing MS(R) may go for industry jobs, and PhD can be done after finishing M. Tech.</p>
